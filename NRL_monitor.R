#Need to add hover over dots for home or away too (or a colour change, maybe with factor?)

#factors), last 3 games against this particular opponent, 'strength of regression to the mean'


#################################
#Experimental from this point on:
#################################


#Notes: try putting points differential through a logb(x,1.2) function
#so that big blow outs don't factor too much. BUT need to account for 
#negatives first by breaking into 'win and loss by how much.'
#Tried this but didn't work so well: 
#Also try exponential smoothing, so that things closer in time are 
#more significant. ses function (setting initial="simple") and
#explore different values of Î±

#If they've just come off a big game (let's define as playing a top 4 side) and won,
#they are less likely to score a lot of points in the next game.

#Days rest?

#Forward metres gained?

#Total points against other top 8 teams of this year vs. total points
#against other bottom 8 teams of other team.

#Try finding a team they are similar to. E.g. team A beats team C by 14, team B beats team C
#by 16, then A and B are similar. So if a team has a probably with team A, they should also have
#a problem with team B.
